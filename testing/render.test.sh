# hooks/render-deployment-docs.sh runs in the build box, which has python3 but

# is live. This runs the hook on a scaffolded app under a python3 with no
# third-party packages (and again under the system python3 when it has
# PyYAML), and checks the record names both Workers, reads the workspace from
# intent.yaml when none is passed, and renders the README section. The probes
# go to the network (workers.dev answers any name, a 404 for a Worker that is
# not there), so the record is checked for a status on each row, not for one
# status.
